		1) error

		5)METHOD PARAMTERS:Information can be passed to methods as parameter.
		Parameters act as variables inside the method.
		Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses.
		 You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.
          for example String is called parameters.
		6)COMPLIE TIME POLYMORPHISM: complie time polymorphism is known as a static polymorphism is a type of
		                             polymorphism that resolved at complie time.
									 It occurs when the decision take in method or function to call is made by the
									 compile based on the method or number of the types of arguments during the function call.
								Two common ways to achieve compile-time polymorphism are method overloading and operator by method overloading.
								 
								 class Number{
								 void main(int a, int b){
								 System.out.println("Sum of two="+ (a*b));
								 }
								 }
								 class Polymorphism{
								 public stati void main(String[]args){
								 Number number=new Number();
								 number.num(8,10);
								 number.num(4,10,9);
								 }
								 }
			10)CONSTRUCTOR CHAINING:Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another
			                         constructor with respect to current object is called constructor chaining.
									 
									 Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in the same class.
                                      From base class: by using super() keyword to call the constructor from the base class.
									  class Person {
                                       String name;
                                        int age;
										public Person(String name, int age) {
                                           this.name = name;
                                           this.age = age;
                                            }
											public Person(String name) {
                                            this(name, 0);
											}
											 public Person() {
                                                 this("Unknown", 0}
												 }
												 public void displayInfo() {
                                                  System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
                                                      }
                                                 }
												 
			11)public class FibonacciRecursion {
                      public static void main(String[] args) {
                            int n = 10; 
                     System.out.println("Fibonacci Sequence:");
                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(fibonacci(i) + " ");
            }
         }
		            public static int fibonacci(int n) {
                     if (n <= 1) {
                      return n;
                      else {
                    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
                    }
                }
             }	
			 
			 
			 
			 12)  If a number is not completely divisible by two, then it is considered an odd number.
			      For such numbers, dividing them by two always leaves a remainder of one.
				  For example: 11 is an odd number because dividing by two leaves 1 as a remainder. 
				  It is not completely divisible by 2. The 1 in the unit place indicates the number as odd.
			
			13) We will be using two methods: Arrays.sort() and Arrays.equals() from the java.util package to solve .
			    The Arrays.sort() method sorts the elements of the array in increasing order.
			    The Arrays.equals() method checks the equality of the two arrays in terms of size, data, and order of elements.
			
			14) An enumeration is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection.
			
			15), the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) goes through several steps to allocate memory, initialize the object.
			      inside the JVM when you create an object
				  class loading
				  memory allocation
				  object initialize
				  Constructor
				  
				  
			16)In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects.
                    Data members
					Method
					Constructor
					Sstatic 
					Inner class
					Acess modifier
					Inheritances
					Polymorphism
					Overloading
